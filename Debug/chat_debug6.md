That error is a straight-up temporal dead zone (TDZ) bug: you‚Äôre using fullFilename in a template/string before it‚Äôs declared with let/const. When the service worker hits that line it throws, so your upload never happens‚Äîhence ‚Äúhandoff generated‚Äù toast but nothing in the repo.

What to change (surgical + safe)

Move all filename + path derivations above any place they‚Äôre referenced, and only build the signal after you‚Äôve uploaded the full file and have its real URL.

1) Declare names first (before any usage)

Put this near the top of your handoff routine (whatever wraps the uploads ‚Äî e.g. handleClaudeJson / processConversation):

// === filenames & paths FIRST ===
const title = (json?.name || 'untitled').trim();
const safeTitle = title
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')
  .replace(/(^-|-$)/g, '');

const ts = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '').replace('T','-').replace('Z','Z');

const dir = 'handoffs';                    // or 'handoffs/duoecho' if you‚Äôre nesting
const fullFilename   = `duoecho-full-${safeTitle}-${ts}.md`;
const signalFilename = `duoecho-signal-${safeTitle}-${ts}.md`;

const fullPath   = `${dir}/${fullFilename}`;
const signalPath = `${dir}/${signalFilename}`;

Why: anything like
".../blob/main/${fullFilename}" or "Full details: ‚Ä¶" must not run before these exist.

2) Upload FULL first, then compute real link

const fullResp = await putFile({
  owner, repo, path: fullPath, branch,
  message: `chore: add ${fullFilename}`,
  contentBase64: b64(fullMarkdown),
  token: GITHUB_TOKEN
});

// Prefer the URL GitHub returns; fall back to blob URL
const fullUrl =
  fullResp?.content?.html_url ||
  fullResp?.html_url ||
  `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}/blob/${branch}/${fullPath}`;

3) Now generate the SIGNAL (pass the real link)

const signalMarkdown = generateSignalFromJson(json, {
  fullUrl,                      // << use the actual link
  tokenBudget: 1200,            // your current budget
  structured: true              // your template toggle
});

await putFile({
  owner, repo, path: signalPath, branch,
  message: `chore: add ${signalFilename}`,
  contentBase64: b64(signalMarkdown),
  token: GITHUB_TOKEN
});

4) Common spots that sneak this bug in
	‚Ä¢	Building a placeholder link with `.../${fullFilename}` above the declaration.
	‚Ä¢	Logging with console.log('Uploading', fullFilename) before it‚Äôs defined.
	‚Ä¢	Passing { fullFilename } into generateSignalFromJson that immediately interpolates it.

Search for fullFilename and make sure no reference appears before the block in step 1.

5) Optional guard (won‚Äôt fix TDZ, but avoids bad links)

Inside generateSignalFromJson, accept fullUrl (not fullFilename) and default it:

function generateSignalFromJson(json, opts = {}) {
  const fullUrl = opts.fullUrl || 'üîó Full handoff link will appear here after upload';
  // ...
  return `${body}\n\n**Full details:** ${fullUrl}\n`;
}

Quick test checklist (60 seconds)
	1.	Ctrl/Cmd-F fullFilename ‚Üí verify its first occurrence is the declaration.
	2.	In SW console, run one capture. No red error? ‚úÖ
	3.	Confirm full file appears in GitHub first, then signal; signal‚Äôs link opens the full. ‚úÖ

If you still see nothing in the repo after this, paste the ~40 lines around the upload block (the putFile calls) and I‚Äôll patch them line-by-line.
