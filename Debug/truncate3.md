You’re right—the last write-up was long. Here’s the tight version.

Recommendation (do both):
	•	Full canonical handoff (lossless) — archive it (file/gist/storage).
	•	Smart 500-token handoff — generated from the same source via typed compression + token budgeting.

How to implement (minimal skeleton):

type Msg = { role:'user'|'assistant'|'system'; text:string; ts?:number };

export function generateHandoff(msgs: Msg[], storeFull:(s:string)=>string, budget=500){
  const sigs = toSignals(msgs);                // regex heuristics → problem/fix/decision/next/code
  const kind = detectType(sigs);               // 'debugging'|'architecture'|'implementation'|'general'
  const full = renderFullMarkdown(msgs);       // your existing detailed template
  const fullRef = storeFull(full);             // returns URL/ID
  const outline = compressByType(kind, sigs);  // type-specific sections
  const quick = renderWithinBudget(outline, { tokenBudget: budget, linkToFull: fullRef });
  return { kind, quick, fullRef };
}

Rules that keep it under 500 tokens:
	•	Never truncate mid-sentence or inside code.
	•	Code → summarize (signatures + LOC + short hash) and point to full.
	•	Per type:
	•	Debugging: Problem (≤2 sentences) → What worked (≤2) → Next (≤3 bullets).
	•	Architecture: Question → 2–3 options (1-line pros/cons) → Decision → Next.
	•	Implementation: What shipped (names) → Behavior (1 line each) → Next.

Why this works: structure-first extraction, type-aware compression, strict token budgeter.

Want me to drop in toSignals, detectType, and a tiny budgeter as a PR-ready file?
