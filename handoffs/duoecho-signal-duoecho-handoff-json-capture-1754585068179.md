## Decisions
-  Got it! **duoecho-extension-v1.0-stable** is your clean production version and **duoecho-extension-TEST** is garbage.

So the copy command should work:

```bash
cd /Users/solbrody/Dev/duoecho/repo
cp -r /Users/solbrody/Dev/SolOS/duoecho-extension-v1.0-stable/* ./extension/
```

If that's still failing, let's debug:

```bash
# Check if the stable folder exists and has content
ls -la /Users/solbrody/Dev/SolOS/duoecho-extension-v1.0-stable/

# Check if you're in the right repo directory
pwd
ls -la ./extension/
```

**What error are you getting exactly?** 
- "No such file or directory" for the source?
- "No such file or directory" for the destination?
- Permission denied?
- Something else?

The copy command looks correct if both paths exist....

-  **Yes, we can fix it.** I handled verbose signal generation earlier in this chat.

## üéØ **What I Would Do:**

**Fix the `generateSignalFromJson()` function** in `duoecho-extension-v1.0-stable/src/background-integrated.js`

The function exists but it's either:
1. **Not actually using verbose=true** (defaulting to compact mode)  
2. **The extraction logic is broken** (not finding decisions/errors in message text)
3. **Message text extraction is failing** (getting empty content)

## üìÅ **File to Update:**

**`/Users/solbrody/Dev/SolOS/duoecho-extension-v1.0-stable/src/background-integrated.js`**

Specifically the `generateSignalFromJson(json, verbose = true)` function around line 300-400.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Testing Approach:**

1. **Work on duoecho-extension-TEST** (throwaway copy)
2. **Fix the...

Hmmm look at: **duoecho/handoff/**duoecho-full-github-file-handoff-duoecho-signal-1754584742200.md. It looks to be ok.
