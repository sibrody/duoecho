1. Fetch and read, GitHub: sibrody/duoecho/handoffs/duoecho-signal-duoecho-extension-debug-protocol-2025-08-08T162706091Z.md
2. Understand the context of existing activities by reading the "Full handoff" and paying particular focus to the last 20% of the conversation. Confirm you have read the full handoff COMPLETELY and readback current state.
3. You were in the middle of implementing fixes called out in ~/Dev/duoecho/debug/chat_debug15.md [there are a series of debug files chat_debug1...chat_debug15]
4. You may need to look at chat_debut8-11 for the signal issue.
5. Active codebase is: ~/Dev/duoecho/extension
6. Confirm your understand of where we are and why.
7. Identify succinctly your plan of action. No coding.

 I'll help you understand the current state and context. Let me start by searching the project knowledge for the handoff document and debug files.

 I'll help you understand the current state and identify the next steps. Let me start by fetching the handoff document and reading through the context.

Correct. As I was generating the above referenced handoff in the prompt, the hud for tracking progress of the capture did show on the bottom of the page. The hud for tokens remaining does not.

---

### **Assistant** (1:06:14 PM)

 Perfect! That clarifies the situation significantly. So we have:

## Current Status Clarification

‚úÖ **Working**: 
- Capture progress HUD shows on page during generation
- Popup progress bar works
- Basic signal generation works

‚ùå **Missing**: 
- **Token budget/remaining HUD** - the specific display showing "Tokens: X/Y (remaining Z)"
- **Sophisticated signal quality** from chat_debug8/11 era

## Refined Plan of Action

Based on this clarification and chat_debut15.md, I need to implement:

### Part 1: Restore Sophisticated Signal Generation
- Add the missing helper functions (`lastAssistantText`, `lastUserAction`, `extractRecentAndDecisions`, etc.)
- Replace current `generateSignalFromJson()` with the sophisticated version
- Ensure no progressive degradation of existing functionality

### Part 2: Add Token Budget HUD (the missing piece)
From chat_debut15.md "Remaining tokens" section:

1. **Background**: Add `emitBudget(used, limit)` function that sends `duoechoTokenBudget` events
2. **Content Script**: Add listener for `duoechoTokenBudget` messages that displays:
   ```
   Tokens: X/Y (remaining Z)
   ```
3. **Integration**: Call `emitBudget()` during signal generation at key checkpoints

The capture progress HUD is already working, but we need to add the **token budget display** that shows the actual remaining token count instead of just the progress percentage.

This is much more focused - I don't need to fix HUD creation (it works), just add the token budget functionality and restore the sophisticated signal generation.

Should I proceed with implementing these two specific fixes?

Please verify this is correct based off of work started in the previous chat with chat_debug14 and moving to chat_debug15.md

---

### **Assistant** (1:07:18 PM)

 You're absolutely right - let me verify this against the actual work flow from chat_debug14 to chat_debug15. Let me read chat_debug14 to understand what was implemented and what led to chat_debug15:

---

### **Human** (1:07:57 PM)

Yes

### **Assistant** (1:10:15 PM)

 Perfect! Now I'll implement the fixes precisely as specified. Let me start by examining the current state of the files and then apply the surgical fixes.

### **Human** (2:20:42 PM)

Read ~/Dev/duecho/debug/chat_debug16.md to end. Teach back. No coding until I give go ahead.

### **Human** (2:23:43 PM)

Proceed

---

### **Assistant** (2:29:06 PM)

 I'll implement the fixes from chat_debug16.md exactly as specified. Let me start with each file in order:

## 1) json-sniffer.js ‚Äî Add background readiness check

Add a tiny build banner to the background log so you can always tell what‚Äôs running:

```
js
```

CopyEdit
`// at the very top of background-integrated.js console.log(`[DuoEcho] Build ${chrome.runtime.getManifest().version} ‚Ä¢ ${chrome.runtime.id}`);`

### **Assistant** (4:06:26 PM)

### **Human** (4:26:37 PM)

A tiny banner in the background log is actually useful‚Äîas long as it‚Äôs **one line, once per SW start**, and carries real signal.
Here‚Äôs a clean pattern I recommend:

```js
// at very top of src/background-integrated.js
(() => {
  if (globalThis.__duoechoBannerShown) return;
  globalThis.__duoechoBannerShown = true;

  const VERSION = '1.1.0';
  const BUILD = 'v1.1-stable';   // or env/commit short SHA
  const TS = new Date().toISOString();

  // collapsed group keeps logs tidy
  console.groupCollapsed(`üöÄ DuoEcho SW v${VERSION} (${BUILD}) ‚Äî ${TS}`);
  console.log('Cold-start:', chrome.runtime?.id);
  console.log('Handoffs dir:', 'handoffs/');
  console.log('Repo:', 'github.com/sibrody/duoecho');
  console.groupEnd();
})();

```

Tiny tweaks to make it *buttery*:
* Gate with an env flag so prod can go quiet:

```js
const DEV = true; if (!DEV) console.log = () => {};

```

* Prefix other logs with roles: `[SW]`, `[CS]`, `[POP]` to triage quickly.
* Log **SW lifecycle** once: `chrome.runtime.onInstalled`, `onStartup`, `onSuspend`‚Äîhelps when chasing cold start.
If you want the same feel in content script & popup, mirror it with:

```js
console.log('[CS] DuoEcho loaded @', location.href);
// and
console.log('[POP] DuoEcho popup ready');

```

That‚Äôll keep the banner helpful without adding noise or risking the ‚ÄúStatus 15‚Äù gremlins again.

### **Assistant** (4:26:44 PM)

 Perfect suggestions! Let me implement the clean banner pattern with the collapsed group and proper logging prefixes.
