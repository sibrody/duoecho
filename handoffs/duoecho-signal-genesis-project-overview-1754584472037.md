## Decisions
-  Got it - the working extension code is in `~/Dev/SolOS/duoecho-extension/`, not in the GitHub repo I was looking at.

Since I can't access your local files directly, I need you to help me see the current state of the extension code to identify what broke.

**Can you**:

1. **Check the current extension files** in `~/Dev/SolOS/duoecho-extension/` 
2. **Look for the signal generation logic** - probably in a file like `content-spectrum.js` or similar
3. **Find the code that creates the handoff format**

**Specifically looking for**:
- The function that generates the signal markdown
- The template/format that creates the header with ID, timestamp, hash
- The logic that structures Problem/Fixed/Next sections

**What we need to restore**:
