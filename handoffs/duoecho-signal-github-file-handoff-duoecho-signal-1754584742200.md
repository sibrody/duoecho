## Decisions
- **What’s happening  🤔**

A chrome.runtime.sendMessage() **from a content-script** is delivered to the **background service worker**, **not** directly to other extension pages (e.g. the popup).
Unless the background script explicitly re-broadcasts (or the popup connects via a Port), the popup will never see the message—so your button stays in the “Waiting…” state even though the content script said “ready”.

You already proved messaging works in the other direction (popup → content-script) because the background is relaying the “ping” messages. We just need to add the symmetric relay for “duoEchoConversationReady”


**1 - Add a tiny relay in **
**background-integrated.js**


```
// background-integrated.js (or whatever your SW filename is)

// One relay for ALL DuoEcho events you might add...
-  I'll implement all 4 tweaks to fix file naming and enhance the metadata. Let's start:

## Tweak 1: Enhanced Ready Message with Title...
